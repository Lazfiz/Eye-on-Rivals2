            "Abstract": "用于测定眼睛的主观折射特性的方法和系统\n本发明涉及一种用于基于使用自然图像来测定受试者的眼睛的主观折射特性的系统。本发明还涉及一种用于基于使用自然图像或自然场景来测定受试者的眼睛的主观折射特性的方法，以及自然图像用于测定受试者的眼睛的主观折射特性的用途。\n为了进行主观折射率的测定，已知如测试眼镜或综合验光仪的研究设备，其中在受试者的眼睛前方旋转例如球状或柱状的试验镜片，以借助于受试者的反馈测定其视觉缺陷。\n在根据国家和国际标准测定主观折射时总是使用限定的视力字符，也称为视标。视标为具有高对比度的白底黑字。适用作标准化的DIN视力字符的朗多尔环（Lando",

            "Abstract": "减小透镜形状和未切割的透镜毛坯的厚度的方法\n技术领域\n本发明针对一种方法，该方法用于为未切割的透镜毛坯提供修改后的透镜形状，尤其是用于减小未切割的透镜形状的厚度。此外，本发明针对一种用于制造眼镜片的未切割的透镜毛坯。\n背景技术\n近年来，所谓的单独设计的眼镜片的数量已经明显增加。这些单独设计的眼镜片考虑预期的佩戴者的多个个体参数。此外，不仅较低阶的像差而且较高阶的像差的矫正的需求都稳定增加。这都导致越来越多的透镜被设计为具有“自由形状表面”，即，不再禁止任何对称性的表面。例如，通过为每个表面在整个区域上提供矢高来确定完整的表面分布，并转发至制造位置，例如，",
