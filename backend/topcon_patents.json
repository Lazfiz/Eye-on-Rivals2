Further, the present invention provides a perimetric instrument which can automatically make a determination of an additional target. In particular, according to the present invention, a multilayer neural network including an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer introduces a neural weight ratio which is determined based on responses when the visual field is normal and abnormal, and as a response from a responding section is inputted to the input layer while an output from the output layer is sent out to an analogical inferring section, the analogical inferring section can analogically infer an abnormal visual field pattern of the measurement object person. Accordingly, it is possible to help judgment of an abnormal visual field pattern by a measurer, and since also labor, time and so forth of the measurer are reduced, burdens to the measurer and them easurement object person can be reduced remarkably.",

CONSTITUTION:A vertically-rotating shaft 22 is set on a table 18, and a main body 55 is thereon set through a horizontally-rotating shaft 24. A lock shaft 36 is rotation-freely and vertically set and a horizontal groove 43 for changing the diameter is graved thereon. A lock plate 46 with a position in the vertical direction coinciding with the horizontal channel is set on the vertically-rotating shaft and a fitting element 28 opposedly set to the lock shaft placed through a hole 47 which is graved on the lock plate 46 and is fittable at a position of a larger diameter is set on the main body side. Then, a groove 44 is set on the lock shaft, and a projected part 27 to be inserted in the groove is set on the fitting element to provide a lock shaft rotating means 53 in such a way that a gap in the vertical direction between the groove and the projected part is changed by the rotating position of the lock shaft. It is thereby possible to make an allowance in the vertical and horizontal rotating directions by rotating the lock shaft and to perform positionings in the up and down and the left and right directions. In addition, locking is released by elevating a shaft 30 movable in the up and down direction and a movement in the forward and backward direction is made possible.",

CONSTITUTION:An observation optical system is equipped with an area sensor I, which receives a fluorescence from a fundus, and barrier filters B1, B2 for visible fluorescence and infrared fluorescence respectively, which are possible to be turned into or out of the optical path. A controller 70 is made to judge between early, middle and later stages of a circulation time of fluorescent agent based upon a received light signal from the area sensor I by an input from a joystick switch 61, and controls a solenoid 76 to make the barrier filter inserted into or drawn out of the photographic optical path. By using the aforementioned configuration, when a received light signal, which is put out of a light receiving sensor receiving a fluorescence from the fundus, becomes smaller than a specified value, the controller makes the barrier filter inserted into the photographic optical path at every operation of photo-taking switch so as to make an alignment easy in a later stage of the circulation time of the fluorescent agent.",

            "Abstract": "PURPOSE:To obtain a laser operation device for ophthalmology, which can be utilized for plural operation systems, by composing the device of a light source, which emits an infrared laser light to have a specified central wavelength, and an irradiation optical system to irradiate an operated eye with the infrared laser light. CONSTITUTION:The laser operation device is mostly composed of a light source system 1, an irradiation optical system 2 and an alignment optical system 100 and the light source system 1 has an infrared laser 10 as a laser light source, for example, an HF laser which has the emitting wavelength of 2.9mum. Since the beam cross section of a pulse laser light LB has the rectangular shape of (a)X(b) when the device is used by a stable resonator, the laser beam is enlarged and shaped to the laser beam LB, whose cross section has the almost square shape of (b)X(b), by a cylindrical expander 21. Further, the laser beam diameter is reduced to the cross section of (c)X(c) by a reverse expander 24. An attenuator 30 is arranged between the cylindrical expander 21 and reverse expander 24 and glass boards 31, 32 and 33 are selectively inserted. Then, the energy intensity of the laser beam LB is adjusted. As a result, the laser operation device can be obtained to be utilized to radial keratomy operation or reshaping operation with one device.",

CONSTITUTION:A nozzle 8a is aligned with the eye to be examined of an examinee in the measurement of intraocular pressure and an air pulse is injected to the eye to be examined at the measuring time of intraocular pressure. This nozzle part 7 is protected by a dust preventing cap 9 when intraocular pressure is not measured and the cap 9 is mounted on a nozzle part 8. A sterilizing ray generating light source 10 as a sterilizing ray generating means and a pressure sensor 11 are provided to the cap 9 on the side opposed to the nozzle 8a when said cap 9 is mounted on the nozzle part 8. As the sterilizing ray generating light source 10, for example, a light source generating a ray having a wavelength of an ultraviolet region is used. A detection circuit 17 detects the conductive state of the pressure sensor and supply of a current to the sterilizing ray generating light source 10 is started on the basis of the detection of said conductive state.",

CONSTITUTION:A refractivity examination apparatus 300 is constituted so that an upper stand 302 and a housing 303 are operated so as to be finely moved before and behind, left and right as well as up and down to align the right eye measuring optical system 310 provided in a right eye measuring part 303a with the apex of the cornea of an eye ER (right eye) to be examined. Herein, since the distance between optical axes O1-O2 is set corresponding to the pupillary distance of the eye to be examined and the position of a fixation target, when the optical axis O1 is matched with the optical axis of the eye ER (right eye) to be examined and aligned with the apex of the cornea of the eye ER (right eye) to be examined, a left eye measuring optical system 311 is aligned with the apex of the cornea of an eye EL (left eye) to be examined. As mentioned above, only by aligning the right eye measuring optical system 310 with the eye ER (right eye) to be examined by an examiner, the left eye measuring optical system 311 can be also automatically aligned with the eye EL (left eye).",

CONSTITUTION:From the first and the second laser beam sources 1 and 5, visual laser beam and infrared laser beam are emitted. Infrared laser beam emitted from the source 5 enters into a two dimensional scanner 7 through a beam splitter 6 after reflected by a half mirror 4. This scanner 7 scans the fundus of a test eye H and reflected laser beam which has reflected in the fundus is received by a photodetector 9. Light receiving signals is input in a indicator 11 in accordance with the amount of light received to produce fundic image, which can be observed. Since a light modulating circuit 3 modulating signals during a certain period, the light modulating circuit 2 emits visual laser beam from the first laser beam source 1. In this way, reaction of a subject can be examined by giving stimulation of desired strength.",
